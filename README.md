**Welcome!**

These pages present results obtained during the PhD of Elliot Dreujou (Université du Québec à Rimouski - Institut des Sciences de la Mer).

If you have any question, do not hesitate to contact me at: *elliot.dreujou(at)uqar.ca*

> **Latest updates** (*December 11th*)<br>
- Addition of ANCOVA results
- Update of regressions:
 - characteristic species removed as dependent variables along with their respective Poisson GLM
 - depth removed as independant variable, as it is useless for the local campaign and it is now included in the regional campaign's ANCOVA
 - outliers and correlated variables updated with the new model design
 - DistLM updated in PRIMER and plotted with R, without outlier stations and correlated variables
- Tidying of scripts and functions

**Previous major updates** (*November 22nd*)<br>
- Update of Chap1 scripts, with enhanced maps and barplots
- Addition of current version of analyses for Chap2
