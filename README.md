# 2. Evaluation of environmental status

This [script](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap2/C2_analyses.html) compile all analyses.

# 3. Community structure and local exposure

Calculations of indices of influence are presented [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap3/C3_analyses_A.html), regressions are [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap3/C3_analyses_B.html) and species distribution modelling are [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap3/C2_analyses_C.html).

The SDM page is not operational yet, it will be updated in a future version.
