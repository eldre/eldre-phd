**Welcome!**

These pages present results obtained during the PhD of Elliot Dreujou (Université du Québec à Rimouski - Institut des Sciences de la Mer) :

*Influence des activités humaines sur les écosystèmes benthiques d’une zone industrialo-portuaire subarctique : application d’indicateurs de statut écologique et prédiction de la structure des communautés*

If you have any question, do not hesitate to contact me (*elliot.dreujou(at)uqar.ca*).

> **Current update** (*March 27*)<br>
- Update of the human exposure scores (C3) and related analyses
- Reorganization of webpages
- Minor corrections

> **Previous major updates**<br>
- Addition of HMSC models considering all variables (predictions impossible at the bay scale with the rasters)
- Addition of validation table for SDM predictions of taxa richness

# 1. Characterization of the ecosystems

This chapter is published in *Water* (online version [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/9/2424)). Scripts and datasets are stored on CHONe II's Dataverse repository (online version [here](https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/5LJYXO)).

Two types of analysis have been done:

- the first with all stations pooled together where similarity clusters have been defined and examined
- the second with a differenciation by sampling campaigns and the use of *a priori* factors such as condition or region

## 1.1. Global analysis

Maps and figures can be found [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap1/C1_analyses_A.html), and analyses and regressions are [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap1/C1_analyses_B.html).

## 1.2. Analysis by campaign

### 1.2.1. 2014 campaign

Maps and figures can be found [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap1/C1_analyses_14A.html), and analyses and regressions are [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap1/C1_analyses_14B.html).

### 1.2.2. 2016 campaign

Maps and figures can be found [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap1/C1_analyses_16A.html), and analyses and regressions are [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap1/C1_analyses_16B.html).

### 1.2.3. 2017 campaign

Maps and figures can be found [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap1/C1_analyses_17A.html), and analyses and regressions are [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap1/C1_analyses_17B.html).

# 2. Evaluation of environmental status

This chapter is published in *Frontiers in Marine Science* (online version [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.637546)). Scripts and datasets are stored on CHONe II's Dataverse repository (online version [here](https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/WDDDMI)).

Calculation of indicators are presented [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap2/C2_analyses_A.html), and statistical analyses are [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap2/C2_analyses_B.html).

# 3. Modelling of exposure from human activities

This chapter is in preparation, to be submitted in mid-2021 to *Elementa, Science of the Anthropocene* or *PLoS ONE*.

Calculations of indices of influence are presented [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap3/C3_analyses_A.html), statistical analyses are [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap3/C3_analyses_B.html), and species distribution modelling are [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap3/C3_analyses_C.html).
