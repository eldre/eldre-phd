- Splitting of analyses scripts, discrimination between shallow and deep stations
- Addition of bootstraping for indicators' mean
- Various housekeeping

> **Previous major updates**<br>

# 1. Characterization of the ecosystems

All analyses can be found with this [page](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap1/C1_index.html).

# 2. Evaluation of environmental status

Calculation of indicators are presented [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap2/C2_analyses_A.html) and statistical analyses are [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap2/C2_analyses_B.html).

# 3. Community structure and local exposure

Calculations of indices of influence are presented [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap3/C3_analyses_A.html), regressions are [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap3/C3_analyses_B.html) and species distribution modelling are [here](https://eldre.github.io/eldre-phd/Chap3/C2_analyses_C.html).

The SDM page is not operational yet, it will be updated in a future version.
